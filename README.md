# Hospital-Management-System
A Hospital Management System (HMS) is an integrated platform that streamlines hospital operations by managing patient registration, appointment booking, doctor scheduling, and administrative tasks. It enables patients to easily register and book services, allows doctors to manage schedules and access patient records, and provides administrators with tools to oversee operations efficiently. With dedicated sections for hospital information and contact details, the HMS ensures seamless communication and coordination across all stakeholders. This system enhances healthcare delivery, optimizes resource utilization, and improves the overall patient experience.
