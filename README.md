# Hospital-Management-System
A Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate various administrative and operational processes within a healthcare facility. In today’s fast-paced healthcare environment, the need for efficient management of patient data, medical records, billing, scheduling, and inventory has become crucial to ensure smooth hospital operations and high-quality patient care.
The traditional paper-based methods of managing hospital operations are often prone to errors, delays, and inefficiencies, which can impact patient care and overall hospital performance. A well-designed HMS addresses these challenges by integrating various functions such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical history management, billing, and inventory tracking into a single, centralized platform. This integration allows healthcare professionals to access real-time data, make informed decisions, and improve the overall quality of care.
Moreover, the system helps optimize resource management, minimize operational costs, and enhance communication among departments, ultimately leading to improved patient satisfaction and operational efficiency. As healthcare facilities continue to grow in size and complexity, the importance of an automated and reliable hospital management system has become increasingly evident.
This project aims to develop and implement a Hospital Management System that will address the challenges of managing patient information, scheduling, billing, and other critical tasks, improving both administrative efficiency and the quality of patient care.


# FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

# 1. Patient Registration Page:
oUser Registration: Allow patients to create an account by entering personal details such as name, date of birth, contact information, and medical history.
oProfile Management: Allow patients to update their profiles and contact details after registration.
# 2.Doctor Registration Page:
oDoctor Registration: Allow doctors to register by providing details like their name, specialty, qualifications, contact information, and availability.
# 3.Admin Registration Page:
oAdmin Registration: Allow admins to create and manage other user accounts (patient, doctor) by entering necessary details (name, email, role).
oRole-based Access Control: Ensure admins have the ability to assign different roles to users (e.g., doctor, patient).
# 4.About Page:
oHospital Information: Provide detailed information about the hospital, its services, history, and mission.

# NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

# 1.Performance:
The web pages should load within 3 seconds to ensure a smooth user experience.
The system should be able to handle simultaneous access by multiple users without lag.
# 2. Security:
All user data (especially personal and medical information) should be encrypted to ensure privacy and comply with data protection regulations.
The system should implement secure login and registration processes, using HTTPS and two-factor authentication for sensitive pages (such as Admin).
# 3. Usability:
The web pages should have an intuitive, easy-to-navigate design that provides a seamless experience for patients, doctors, and administrators.
All forms (registration, contact) should provide clear error messages and validation to guide users during submission.
# 4.Scalability:
The system should be designed to handle an increasing number of users, particularly as the number of patients, doctors, and admin accounts grows.
# 5. Compatibility:
The web pages must be compatible with various browsers and mobile devices  to ensure access for a diverse user base.
The site should have a responsive design to automatically adjust for screen sizes.
# 6.  Availability:
The system should have high uptime, ideally 99.9%, with minimal downtime for maintenance.
Backup mechanisms should be in place to recover any lost data in case of server failure.
